# <strong>Use case of Computer Vision on Medical Domain</strong>
This is an implementation of computer vision. I have designed frontend of this project.

# About
* Brain Tumor detection

Here user can detect if mri has tumor or not. Brain MRI scan is needed for this task. This is a binary classification task.

* Types of Brain Tumor

This model can detect if any Brain MRI scan has a tumor or not. If it contains a tumor then the type of tumor it has. This model can classify 3 types of brain tumors glioma, meningioma, and pituitary.
